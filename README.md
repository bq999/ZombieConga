To get this tutorial, get the first edition of iOS Games By Tutorials by Ray Wenderlich - http://www.raywenderlich.com/store/ios-games-by-tutorials
*Note:  His second edition of the book now uses Swift.  I am still following the first edition that uses modern Objective-C

This is a simple game where you control a zombie and run around collecting cats (in a Snake-game style fashion).
You must also beware of the evil Cat Ladies who will hurt the zombie and take some of your cats from you!


To win, collect 30 cats in your conga line.  But beware, you only have 5 lives.  If you get attacked by too
many cat ladies, you may lose :(
